# Monitoring Infrastructure for AI-driven Freight Optimization Platform

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the monitoring infrastructure of the AI-driven Freight Optimization Platform. The monitoring system is designed to provide visibility into system health, performance metrics, business KPIs, and operational data to ensure the platform meets its SLA requirements and business objectives.

## Architecture Overview

The monitoring infrastructure follows a multi-layered approach to collect, process, store, and visualize metrics from all components of the platform:

```
User Interfaces (Grafana Dashboards)
        ↑
Visualization & Alerting (Grafana, Alertmanager)
        ↑
Metrics Storage (Prometheus, Loki, Tempo)
        ↑
Collection Agents (Exporters, Instrumentation)
        ↑
System Components (Services, Databases, Infrastructure)
```

This architecture enables comprehensive monitoring of:
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Application metrics (request rates, error rates, response times)
- Business metrics (load matches, efficiency scores, empty mile reduction)
- Database performance (query times, connection counts, replication status)
- Message queue metrics (lag, throughput, partition status)

## Components

### Prometheus
// Prometheus version: 2.40.0+

Prometheus serves as the primary time-series database for metrics collection and storage. It scrapes metrics from various endpoints, evaluates alert rules, and provides a query language (PromQL) for data analysis.

**Key Files:**
- `prometheus/prometheus.yml`: Main configuration file
- `prometheus/alert-rules.yml`: Alert rule definitions

### Grafana
// Grafana version: 9.3.0+

Grafana provides visualization dashboards for metrics, logs, and traces. It connects to Prometheus and other data sources to create comprehensive views of system performance and business metrics.

**Key Files:**
- `grafana/datasources.yaml`: Data source configurations
- `grafana/dashboards.yaml`: Dashboard provisioning configuration

### Alertmanager
// Alertmanager version: 0.25.0+

Alertmanager handles alert routing, grouping, and notifications. It receives alerts from Prometheus and routes them to the appropriate channels based on severity and category.

**Key Files:**
- `alertmanager/alertmanager.yml`: Alert routing configuration

### Exporters

Various exporters collect metrics from specific components:

- Node Exporter: System metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
// Node Exporter version: 1.5.0+
- PostgreSQL Exporter: Database metrics
- Redis Exporter: Cache metrics
- MongoDB Exporter: Document database metrics
- Kafka Exporter: Message queue metrics

### Loki
// Loki version: 2.7.0+

Loki provides centralized log aggregation and querying capabilities, integrated with Grafana for visualization.

### Tempo
// Tempo version: 2.0.0+

Tempo enables distributed tracing to track requests across service boundaries, helping to identify performance bottlenecks.

## Installation and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with Helm

### Installation Steps

1. **Deploy Prometheus Stack**

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm install monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  -f values/prometheus-values.yaml \
  --namespace monitoring --create-namespace
```

2. **Deploy Additional Exporters**

```bash

helm install loki grafana/loki-stack -f values/loki-values.yaml --namespace monitoring
helm install tempo grafana/tempo -f values/tempo-values.yaml --namespace monitoring
```

5. **Configure Grafana Dashboards**

```bash
kubectl apply -f grafana/dashboards/ -n monitoring
```

## Metrics Collection

### Infrastructure Metrics

Infrastructure metrics are collected from Kubernetes nodes and pods using Node Exporter and cAdvisor:

- CPU usage and load
- Memory usage and allocation
- Disk usage, I/O, and latency
- Network traffic, errors, and latency
- System load and process counts

### Application Metrics

Application metrics are collected through instrumentation in each service:

- Request rates and throughput
- Error rates and types
- Response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Resource utilization
- Business-specific metrics

### Database Metrics

Database metrics are collected using specialized exporters:

- Query performance and execution counts
- Connection utilization
- Replication status and lag
- Cache hit ratios
- Storage utilization

### Message Queue Metrics

Kafka metrics are collected using the Kafka Exporter:

- Topic and partition status
- Producer and consumer rates
- Consumer group lag
- Broker status and performance

### Business Metrics

Custom business metrics specific to the freight optimization platform:

- Load fulfillment rate
- Empty mile reduction percentage
- Driver earnings increase
- Network efficiency score
- Smart hub utilization

## Alerting

### Alert Rules

Alert rules are defined in Prometheus and categorized by component and severity:

- **System Alerts**: Infrastructure and resource utilization issues
- **Service Alerts**: Application-specific performance and availability issues
- **Database Alerts**: Database health and performance issues
- **Message Queue Alerts**: Kafka and event processing issues
- **Business Alerts**: Business KPI threshold violations

Example alert rule from `alerts/system-alerts.yaml`:

```yaml
alert: HostHighCPULoad
expr: 100 - (avg by(instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100) > 80
for: 5m
labels:
  severity: warning
  category: resources
annotations:
  summary: Host high CPU load
  description: CPU load on {{ $labels.instance }} is above 80% for more than 5 minutes
  impact: System performance may be degraded
  action: Check system processes and consider scaling resources
```

### Alert Routing

Alerts are routed based on severity and category:

- **Critical**: Immediate notification via PagerDuty and Slack
- **Warning**: Notification via Slack with delayed escalation
- **Info**: Logged in Slack for awareness

### Escalation Procedures

Escalation procedures are defined for different alert types:

1. **Level 1**: On-call engineer (response time: 30 minutes)
2. **Level 2**: Team lead + on-call engineer (response time: 15 minutes)
3. **Level 3**: Manager + team lead + on-call engineer (response time: 5 minutes)
4. **Level 4**: Incident command + executive notification (immediate response)

## Dashboards

Grafana dashboards are organized by category and user role:

### System Dashboards

- **System Overview**: High-level view of all system components
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Kubernetes-specific metrics and status
- **Node Performance**: Detailed node-level metrics

### Service Dashboards

- **API Gateway**: API traffic, performance, and errors
- **Load Matching Service**: Matching performance and metrics
- **Optimization Engine**: AI optimization performance and metrics

Dashboards are provisioned automatically using the configuration in `grafana/dashboards.yaml`.

## SLA Monitoring

### SLA Definitions

The platform has defined SLAs for various components:

| Service | Availability Target | Performance Target | Measurement Window |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Core Platform | 99.9% | API response p95 < 500ms | Monthly |
| Mobile Applications | 99.5% | App response p95 < 2s | Monthly |

| Payment Processing | 99.99% | Transaction time p95 < 3s | Monthly |
| Reporting & Analytics | 99.5% | Report generation < 30s | Monthly |

### SLA Measurement

SLAs are measured using the following metrics:

- **Availability**: Ratio of successful requests to total requests
- **Performance**: 95th percentile response time
- **Reliability**: Error rate percentage

### SLA Reporting

SLA reports are generated automatically and available through:

- **Real-time Dashboard**: Current SLA status
- **Weekly Reports**: Trend analysis and compliance
