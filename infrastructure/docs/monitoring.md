## Introduction

Overview of the monitoring and observability approach for the AI-driven Freight Optimization Platform, explaining the importance of comprehensive monitoring for ensuring system reliability, performance, and business success.

## Monitoring Architecture

Description of the overall monitoring architecture, including the components (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Loki, Tempo), their relationships, and deployment model within the Kubernetes cluster.

### Components

Detailed description of each monitoring component, its role, and configuration approach.

- **Prometheus** (2.40.0): Open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit used for collecting and storing metrics as time-series data. Configuration is defined in `prometheus.yml` and includes scrape configurations for various services and exporters.
- **Grafana** (9.3.0): Open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It provides tools for visualizing time-series data, creating dashboards, and exploring metrics.
- **Alertmanager** (0.25.0): Handles alerts sent by the Prometheus server. It manages silencing, aggregation, and routing of alerts to appropriate notification channels.
- **Loki** (2.7.0): Log aggregation system designed to be cost-effective and easy to operate. It indexes only metadata about log data, rather than the logs themselves.
- **Tempo** (2.0.0): Distributed tracing backend used to store and query traces generated by the platform's microservices.

### Deployment Model

Explanation of how monitoring components are deployed in the Kubernetes cluster, including resource requirements and high availability considerations.

- Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Loki, and Tempo are deployed as stateful sets within the Kubernetes cluster.
- Each component is configured with appropriate resource requests and limits to ensure stable performance.
- Persistent volumes are used for data storage to ensure data durability.
- High availability is achieved through replication and automated failover mechanisms.

### Data Flow
