This document outlines the disaster recovery strategy, procedures, and implementation for the AI-driven Freight Optimization Platform. It provides comprehensive guidance for ensuring business continuity and data protection in case of system failures or disasters.

## 1. Disaster Recovery Strategy

The disaster recovery strategy for the AI-driven Freight Optimization Platform is designed to ensure business continuity and minimize data loss in the event of system failures or disasters.

### 1.1 Recovery Objectives

| Component | Recovery Time Objective (RTO) | Recovery Point Objective (RPO) | Criticality |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| Critical Services | 1 hour | 5 minutes | High |
| Non-critical Services | 4 hours | 15 minutes | Medium |
| Databases | 1 hour | 5 minutes | High |
| Object Storage | Near zero | Near zero | High |
| ML Models | 2 hours | Last training cycle | Medium |

### 1.2 Disaster Recovery Approach

The platform employs a multi-layered disaster recovery approach:

- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment for resilience against single-AZ failures
- **Warm Standby**: Secondary region with replicated data and standby services
- **Backup and Restore**: Regular backups with tested restoration procedures
- **Automated Recovery**: Automated procedures for common failure scenarios
- **Manual Procedures**: Documented procedures for complex recovery scenarios

### 1.3 Disaster Scenarios

The disaster recovery plan addresses the following scenarios:

| Scenario | Description | Recovery Approach |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Single AZ Failure | Failure of a single availability zone | Automatic failover to other AZs |
| Region Failure | Complete failure of the primary AWS region | Manual failover to secondary region |
| Database Corruption | Corruption of database data | Point-in-time recovery from backups |
| Application Failure | Critical application component failure | Automated rollback or failover |
| Infrastructure Failure | Failure of underlying infrastructure | Automated recreation from IaC |
| Security Incident | Security breach requiring isolation | Containment and clean recovery |
| Data Loss | Accidental or malicious data deletion | Restoration from backups |

### 1.4 Recovery Priorities

In the event of a major disaster requiring prioritized recovery, the following order will be followed:

1. **Core Infrastructure**: VPC, networking, security components
2. **Data Tier**: Databases and data storage systems
3. **Critical Services**: Load matching, driver service, load service
4. **Supporting Services**: Optimization engine, tracking service
5. **Auxiliary Services**: Analytics, reporting, non-critical features

## 2. High Availability Architecture

The platform is designed with high availability as the first line of defense against failures.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "AWS Region - Primary"
        A1[Active Services] --- B1[Primary Databases]
        B1 --- C1[Primary Storage]
    end
    
    subgraph "AWS Region - DR"
        A2[Standby Services] --- B2[Replica Databases]
        B2 --- C2[Replicated Storage]
    end
    
    B1 -.->|Replication| B2
    C1 -.->|Replication| C2
    
    D[Route 53] --- A1
    D -.->|Failover| A2
```

### 3.2 Data Replication

| Data Type | Replication Method | Frequency | Consistency Model |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| RDS PostgreSQL | Logical Replication | Continuous | Eventually Consistent |
| ElastiCache | Cross-Region Replication | Continuous | Eventually Consistent |
| DocumentDB | Manual Snapshots | Daily | Point-in-Time |
| S3 | Cross-Region Replication | Continuous | Eventually Consistent |
| EFS | AWS Backup | Daily | Point-in-Time |
| Kubernetes State | Velero Backups | Hourly | Point-in-Time |

### 3.3 Regional Failover Process

The process for failing over to the secondary region involves the following steps:

1. **Decision to Failover**:
   - Confirm primary region failure or issue
   - Assess impact and necessity of failover
   - Obtain authorization from designated approvers

2. **Pre-Failover Checks**:
   - Verify DR region readiness
   - Confirm data replication status
   - Validate latest backup integrity

3. **Database Failover**:
   - Promote read replicas to primary in DR region
   - Verify database integrity and accessibility
   - Update connection strings if necessary

4. **Application Failover**:
   - Scale up standby services in DR region
   - Verify application health and functionality
   - Update service discovery if necessary

5. **DNS Failover**:
   - Update Route 53 health checks
   - Initiate DNS failover to DR region endpoints
   - Verify DNS propagation

6. **Post-Failover Verification**:
   - Verify end-to-end functionality
   - Confirm data integrity
   - Validate external integrations

7. **Communication**:
   - Notify stakeholders of failover completion
   - Provide status updates and expected impact
   - Establish communication plan for updates

### 3.4 Regional Failback Process

Once the primary region is restored, the following process is used to fail back:

1. **Primary Region Restoration**:
   - Verify primary region availability
   - Restore infrastructure if necessary
   - Validate environment readiness

2. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Establish reverse replication from DR to primary
   - Synchronize data changes made during failover
   - Validate data consistency

3. **Application Preparation**:
   - Deploy and scale application services in primary region
   - Verify application health and functionality
   - Prepare for traffic transition

4. **Gradual Transition**:
   - Implement canary routing to primary region
   - Gradually increase traffic to primary region
   - Monitor for issues during transition

5. **Complete Failback**:
   - Complete DNS failback to primary region
   - Verify all traffic is routed to primary region
   - Confirm system stability

6. **DR Region Reset**:
   - Scale down active services in DR region
   - Reset to standby configuration
   - Re-establish normal replication patterns

### 3.5 Regional Failover Testing

Regular testing of the regional failover process is conducted to ensure readiness:

- **Scheduled Tests**: Quarterly planned failover exercises
- **Scenario-Based Tests**: Simulated disaster scenarios
- **Component Tests**: Individual component failover testing
- **Full DR Tests**: Annual full DR failover exercise

## 4. Backup and Restore Strategy

Comprehensive backup and restore procedures ensure data can be recovered in case of data loss or corruption.

| ElastiCache | Manual Snapshots | Daily | 7 days | AWS Managed |
| DocumentDB | Automated Snapshots | Daily | 30 days | AWS Managed |
| DocumentDB | Transaction Logs | Continuous | 7 days | AWS Managed |
| S3 Data | Versioning | Continuous | 90 days | S3 |
| S3 Data | Cross-Region Replication | Continuous | Same as source | S3 |
| EFS | AWS Backup | Daily | 30 days | AWS Backup |
| Kubernetes State | Velero | Daily | 30 days | S3 |
| Application Configs | Git Repository | Every change | Indefinite | Git + S3 |
| Infrastructure Code | Git Repository | Every change | Indefinite | Git + S3 |

- **ElastiCache**: Scheduled snapshots via AWS Backup
- **S3**: Bucket versioning and replication
- **Kubernetes**: Velero scheduled backups
- **Custom Data**: Application-specific export jobs

Example backup script for custom data:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example backup script for custom data

DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M)
BACKUP_DIR="s3://freight-platform-backups/custom-data/$DATE"

# Export data from application
kubectl exec -n freight-platform deployment/data-service -- /app/scripts/export-data.sh > /tmp/data-export.json

# Upload to S3 with encryption
aws s3 cp /tmp/data-export.json $BACKUP_DIR/data-export.json --sse AES256

# Cleanup
rm /tmp/data-export.json

# Log backup completion
echo "Custom data backup completed at $DATE" | aws sns publish --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:backup-notifications --message file://-

- **Testing Validation**: Validate documentation during DR tests

### 8.3 Runbook Example: RDS Database Recovery

```markdown
# RDS Database Recovery Runbook

## Overview
This runbook provides step-by-step procedures for recovering RDS PostgreSQL databases in various failure scenarios.

## Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Access to AWS Management Console
- Database connection credentials
- Backup information (snapshot IDs or timestamp for point-in-time recovery)

## Recovery Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Primary Instance Failure

1. **Verify Failure**
   - Check RDS console for instance status
   - Verify if automatic failover has occurred
   - Check CloudWatch alarms and events

2. **If Automatic Failover Occurred**
   - Verify new primary is healthy
   - Update connection strings if necessary
   - Verify application connectivity

3. **If Automatic Failover Failed**
   - Initiate manual failover:
     ```bash
     aws rds failover-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier freight-production-db
     ```
   - Monitor failover progress
   - Verify new primary is healthy

4. **Post-Recovery Actions**
   - Verify data integrity
   - Check for replication lag
   - Restore original redundancy if needed

### Scenario 2: Point-in-Time Recovery

1. **Identify Recovery Point**
   - Determine the timestamp for recovery
   - Identify the source database

2. **Initiate Recovery**
   ```bash
   aws rds restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time \
     --source-db-instance-identifier freight-production-db \
     --target-db-instance-identifier freight-recovery-db \
     --restore-time "2023-09-25T04:00:00Z" \
     --db-instance-class db.r6g.2xlarge \
     --multi-az
   ```

3. **Monitor Recovery Progress**
   - Check status in RDS console
   - Wait for instance to become available

4. **Validate Recovered Database**
   - Connect to recovered instance
   - Verify data integrity
   - Run validation queries

5. **Switch to Recovered Database**
   - Update connection strings
   - Verify application connectivity
   - Monitor performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Insufficient Capacity**
   - Try different instance class
   - Try different availability zone
   - Contact AWS support if persistent

2. **Permission Errors**
   - Verify IAM permissions
   - Check for service-linked role issues
   - Verify KMS key permissions if encrypted

3. **Connectivity Issues**
   - Check security group rules
   - Verify subnet configuration
   - Check route tables and NACLs
