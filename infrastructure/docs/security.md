## AI-driven Freight Optimization Platform - Security Guide

This document provides comprehensive documentation of the security architecture, practices, and controls implemented in the AI-driven Freight Optimization Platform. It covers authentication, authorization, data protection, network security, compliance, and operational security measures to ensure the platform's resilience against threats and protection of sensitive logistics data.

## 1. Security Architecture Overview

The AI-driven Freight Optimization Platform implements a defense-in-depth security approach with multiple layers of protection.

### 1.1 Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers to protect against various threats
- **Least Privilege**: Access limited to only what is necessary for each role and service
- **Secure by Design**: Security integrated throughout the development lifecycle
- **Zero Trust**: Verification required for all access regardless of location
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time detection of security events and anomalies
- **Automated Response**: Predefined procedures for common security events
