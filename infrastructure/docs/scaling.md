# 2. Horizontal Scaling

Horizontal scaling involves adding more instances of a service to distribute load. This approach is primarily used for stateless services that can easily scale out to handle increased traffic.

### 2.1 Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

The platform uses Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale the number of pods in a deployment based on observed metrics.

#### 2.1.1 HPA Configuration Example

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: api-gateway
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: api-gateway
    component: api-gateway
    part-of: freight-optimization
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: api-gateway
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 20
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Pods
    pods:
      metric:
        name: http_requests_per_second
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: "1000"
  behavior:
    scaleUp:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60
      policies:
      - type: Pods
        value: 2
        periodSeconds: 60
      - type: Percent
        value: 50
        periodSeconds: 60
      selectPolicy: Max
    scaleDown:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300
      policies:
      - type: Pods
        value: 1
        periodSeconds: 120
      - type: Percent
        value: 10
        periodSeconds: 120
      selectPolicy: Min
```

### 2.2 Service-Specific Scaling Configurations

| Service | Min Replicas | Max Replicas | Primary Scaling Metric | Secondary Metric | Scale-Up Policy | Scale-Down Policy |
|---------|--------------|--------------|------------------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| API Gateway | 3 | 20 | CPU (70%) | Requests per second (1000) | 2 pods or 50% every 60s | 1 pod or 10% every 120s |
| Load Matching | 2 | 15 | CPU (70%) | Queue depth (100) | 2 pods or 50% every 60s | 1 pod or 10% every 120s |
| Driver Service | 3 | 12 | CPU (70%) | Active sessions | 2 pods or 50% every 60s | 1 pod or 10% every 120s |
| Load Service | 3 | 8 | CPU (70%) | Transaction rate | 2 pods or 50% every 60s | 1 pod or 10% every 120s |
| Tracking Service | 3 | 20 | CPU (70%) | Position updates per second (5000) | 2 pods or 50% every 60s | 1 pod or 10% every 120s |
| Optimization Engine | 2 | 10 | CPU (75%) | Job queue length (5) | 1 pod or 30% every 60s | 1 pod or 10% every 180s |
| Notification Service | 2 | 8 | CPU (70%) | Queue length | 2 pods or 50% every 60s | 1 pod or 10% every 120s |

### 2.3 Scaling Behavior Configuration

The platform uses the `behavior` field in HPA configurations to fine-tune scaling behavior:

- **Scale-Up Behavior**: Configured to respond quickly to increased load
  - Short stabilization window (60 seconds) to react promptly to traffic spikes
  - Aggressive scaling policies (2 pods or 50% every 60 seconds)
  - Max policy selection to scale up faster when needed

- **Scale-Down Behavior**: Configured to scale down conservatively
  - Longer stabilization window (300 seconds) to prevent premature scale-down
  - Conservative scaling policies (1 pod or 10% every 120 seconds)
  - Min policy selection to scale down gradually

### 2.4 Custom Metrics for Scaling

In addition to CPU and memory metrics, the platform uses custom metrics for more precise scaling:

| Service | Custom Metric | Collection Method | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| API Gateway | http_requests_per_second | Prometheus metrics | Scale based on actual request load |
| Load Matching | queue_depth | Prometheus metrics | Scale based on pending match requests |
| Tracking Service | position_updates_per_second | Prometheus metrics | Scale based on position update volume |
| Optimization Engine | job_queue_length | Prometheus metrics | Scale based on pending optimization jobs |
| Notification Service | pending_notifications | Prometheus metrics | Scale based on notification backlog |

# 3. Vertical Scaling

Vertical scaling involves increasing resources (CPU, memory) for existing instances. This approach is primarily used for stateful services and components that benefit more from increased resources than from additional instances.

### 3.1 Vertical Scaling Approach

| Component | Scaling Mechanism | Scaling Triggers | Implementation |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Databases | Instance class upgrade | CPU utilization, memory usage, IOPS | AWS RDS instance modification |
| Optimization Engine | Resource limits adjustment | Job queue length, processing time | Kubernetes resource requests/limits |
| ML Training | GPU instance allocation | Training workload | SageMaker instance type selection |
| Elasticsearch | JVM heap size, instance type | Search latency, indexing throughput | Elasticsearch node configuration |

### 3.2 Resource Allocation Strategy

The platform follows these principles for resource allocation:

- **Request-based with headroom**: Set requests at 60% of typical load, limits at 150%
- **Memory-based with safety margin**: Set requests based on application profiling, limits 30% higher
- **Storage with thresholds**: Auto-expand volumes at 80% capacity, review at 90%
- **Network with prioritization**: Prioritize critical traffic, limit non-essential transfers during peaks

### 3.3 Resource Guidelines by Service Type

| Service Type | CPU Request | Memory Request | CPU Limit | Memory Limit | Justification |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| API Services | 0.5 cores | 1 GB | 1 core | 2 GB | Stateless services with moderate resource needs |
| Data Processing | 1 core | 4 GB | 2 cores | 8 GB | Memory-intensive data processing operations |
| ML Inference | 2 cores | 8 GB | 4 cores | 16 GB | Compute-intensive prediction workloads |
| Background Workers | 0.25 cores | 512 MB | 0.5 cores | 1 GB | Lightweight background processing |

    - seriesQuery: 'http_requests_total{kubernetes_namespace!="",kubernetes_pod_name!=""}'
      resources:
        overrides:
          kubernetes_namespace: {resource: "namespace"}
          kubernetes_pod_name: {resource: "pod"}
      name:
        matches: "^(.*)_total$"
        as: "${1}_per_second"
      metricsQuery: 'sum(rate(<<.Series>>{<<.LabelMatchers>>}[2m])) by (<<.GroupBy>>)'
    - seriesQuery: 'queue_depth{kubernetes_namespace!="",kubernetes_pod_name!=""}'
      resources:
        overrides:
          kubernetes_namespace: {resource: "namespace"}
          kubernetes_pod_name: {resource: "pod"}
      name:
        matches: "queue_depth"
        as: "queue_depth"
      metricsQuery: 'avg(<<.Series>>{<<.LabelMatchers>>}) by (<<.GroupBy>>)'
    - seriesQuery: 'job_queue_length{kubernetes_namespace!="",kubernetes_pod_name!=""}'
      resources:
        overrides:
          kubernetes_namespace: {resource: "namespace"}
          kubernetes_pod_name: {resource: "pod"}
      name:
        matches: "job_queue_length"
        as: "job_queue_length"
      metricsQuery: 'avg(<<.Series>>{<<.LabelMatchers>>}) by (<<.GroupBy>>)'
    - seriesQuery: 'position_updates_count{kubernetes_namespace!="",kubernetes_pod_name!=""}'
      resources:
        overrides:
          kubernetes_namespace: {resource: "namespace"}
          kubernetes_pod_name: {resource: "pod"}
      name:
        matches: "^(.*)_count$"
        as: "${1}_per_second"
      metricsQuery: 'sum(rate(<<.Series>>{<<.LabelMatchers>>}[2m])) by (<<.GroupBy>>)'
```

# 8. Scaling Scenarios

This section describes common scaling scenarios and recommended responses for the platform.

### 8.1 Daily Traffic Patterns

**Scenario**: The platform experiences predictable daily traffic patterns with peaks during business hours and lower traffic overnight.

**Scaling Approach**:
- Implement HPA for automatic scaling based on real-time metrics
- Consider scheduled scaling to proactively scale up before known peak periods
- Allow conservative scale-down during off-peak hours
- Monitor and adjust scaling parameters based on observed patterns

### 8.2 Sudden Traffic Spike

**Scenario**: A sudden increase in traffic due to a marketing campaign, news event, or other external factor.

**Scaling Approach**:
- Ensure HPA is configured with appropriate metrics and thresholds
- Configure aggressive scale-up policies to respond quickly to traffic spikes
- Monitor for potential bottlenecks in the scaling process
- Have manual intervention procedures ready for extreme cases

### 8.3 Geographic Expansion

**Scenario**: Expanding the platform to new geographic regions to support global users.

**Scaling Approach**:
- Deploy services to new AWS regions
- Configure Route 53 for latency-based routing
- Set up cross-region data replication as needed
- Implement region-specific monitoring and alerting

### 8.4 Database Growth

**Scenario**: Increasing data volume and query load on databases as the platform grows.

**Scaling Approach**:
- Monitor database performance metrics closely
- Add read replicas to scale read operations
- Implement data partitioning and archiving strategies
- Consider vertical scaling for primary database instances
- Evaluate sharding for extreme scale requirements

### 8.5 Batch Processing Load

**Scenario**: Periodic batch processing jobs (e.g., optimization runs, report generation) creating temporary load spikes.

**Scaling Approach**:
- Schedule batch jobs during off-peak hours when possible
- Configure separate node groups for batch processing workloads
- Use Kubernetes Jobs with appropriate resource requests
- Implement job queuing with prioritization

### 8.6 Seasonal Demand

**Scenario**: Seasonal variations in demand (e.g., holiday shipping season, agricultural harvest periods).

**Scaling Approach**:
- Analyze historical seasonal patterns
- Proactively adjust minimum replica counts before seasonal peaks
- Consider reserved instances for predictable baseline capacity
- Supplement with on-demand or spot instances for peak capacity
